# Carl Higdon's 1974 Alien Encounter: A Critical Examination

The Carl Higdon case represents one of the most intriguing alleged alien abduction incidents of the 1970s, a period characterized by heightened public interest in UFO phenomena. This report examines the details of Higdon's experience, subsequent investigations, and various perspectives on the case that continues to fascinate researchers and skeptics alike nearly fifty years later.

## The McCarty Canyon Incident

On October 25, 1974, 41-year-old Everett "Carl" Higdon Jr. took a vacation day from his oil rig job to hunt elk in the Medicine Bow National Forest south of Rawlins, Wyoming. According to later accounts, Higdon was tracking game in the vicinity of McCarty Canyon when something extraordinary allegedly occurred[^1].

At approximately 4:15 PM, while taking aim at a bull elk, Higdon claimed his bullet appeared to stop in midair "as if an invisible wall stopped it"[^1]. Following this unusual occurrence, Higdon reported encountering a humanoid entity who approached him and communicated that he would be taken aboard a spacecraft[^1]. This being, whom Higdon later referred to as "Ausso One," was described as approximately six feet tall with distinctive physical features including small eyes, no ears, and straw-like hair[^1].

The timeline of events indicates that by 6:30 PM, as darkness fell, Higdon was back at his pickup truck making a radio call[^2]. The vehicle was reportedly found on rough terrain approximately three miles from its original parking location[^2]. At 11:40 PM, some seven and a half hours after Higdon began his hunting expedition, a search party located him in a disoriented state[^1][^2]. He was subsequently transported to Memorial Hospital of Carbon County for medical evaluation and was released after receiving "a clean bill of health"[^1].

## The Abduction Narrative

Under hypnosis conducted by University of Wyoming Counseling Psychologist Dr. Leo Sprinkle, Higdon's full account emerged. His story contained numerous unusual elements that would become central to the case's notoriety.

According to Higdon, after the bullet-stopping incident, he encountered the humanoid being Ausso One, who was wearing a black one-piece outfit resembling a wetsuit[^1]. Higdon described this entity as having a mouth that was "a simple slit with three very large teeth" and a chin that blended directly into its neck[^1]. Notably, Higdon claimed the being appeared to float rather than walk and suggested it might have been an android[^1].

Higdon reported being transported in a transparent "cube shaped craft" that also contained five live elk[^1]. In a 2017 interview with Inception Radio Network, Higdon elaborated on forming a "psychic connection" with Ausso One, even claiming the entity granted his request for rain[^1]. As further evidence of this connection, Higdon stated that Ausso One correctly predicted that his wife's boss would survive a recent cancer diagnosis[^1].

## Investigation and Documentation

Following the incident, Higdon's case was investigated primarily through hypnotic regression sessions. On November 2, 1974, just over a week after the alleged encounter, Higdon underwent his first hypnosis session with Dr. Sprinkle[^2]. A second session followed on November 17, 1974[^2]. These sessions, along with drawings and transcripts, were compiled and documented by researchers[^2].

In 1978, Higdon's case gained wider attention when he appeared on the television program "In Search Of..." in an episode titled "UFO Captives"[^1][^3]. During the program, Higdon participated in a hypnosis session conducted by Dr. Sprinkle and recounted his experience. Additionally, Higdon filmed a reenactment of his experience for the show, depicting his work on an oil drilling rig, walking in the woods with his hunting rifle, medical examinations, and hypnotic sessions with Dr. Sprinkle[^2].

## Critical Analysis and Alternative Explanations

The Higdon case has been subject to significant skeptical inquiry. One notable criticism concerns the possible influence of science fiction literature on Higdon's account. Researcher Gideon Reid has identified striking similarities between Higdon's story and elements from "Le Peril Bleu," a 1911 French science fiction novel by Maurice Renard[^2].

According to Reid's analysis, Renard's novel features "an intelligent non-human species co-exists with humans on an unseen plane in Earth's atmosphere. They are invisible and use invisible machines of an unknown technological variety to trawl Earth's surface collecting samples that are drawn up and held in invisible cages on the boundary to space"[^2]. Reid argues these parallels are too substantial to be coincidental.

Questions have also been raised about the methodology employed during Higdon's hypnosis sessions. Rick Kenyon, an art teacher who was present during Dr. Sprinkle's interviews, reportedly prompted Higdon about specific details, potentially influencing his recollections[^2]. According to transcripts, Kenyon suggested topics like "the interior of the cubicle" and the concept of "time lapse" during sessions[^2]. Additionally, it was Kenyon who initially notified Dr. Sprinkle about Higdon's experience[^2].

The credibility of Dr. Sprinkle's approach has also been scrutinized. By his own admission, Sprinkle had evolved from a "scoffer" to a "believer" in UFO phenomena since 1951, stating: "I accept (tentatively) the following general hypothesis: The Earth is the object of a survey by spacecraft which are piloted by, or controlled by, intelligent beings from some other civilization(s)"[^2]. This pre-existing belief system may have influenced his interpretation of Higdon's account.

Furthermore, polygraph test results administered to Higdon were "not definitive" and potentially indicated "attempted deception," though Dr. Sprinkle ultimately maintained his belief in the authenticity of Higdon's experience[^2].

## Legacy and Cultural Impact

Despite these criticisms, Higdon's story maintained cultural relevance and became an enduring part of UFO lore. In December 2017, Higdon's wife Margery published "Alien Abduction of the Wyoming Hunter: First Person Story of Carl Higdon, October 25, 1974," which further documented the case from a personal perspective[^1][^4][^8].

Throughout his life, Higdon maintained the veracity of his account. According to his wife, the people of Rawlins knew her husband as "an honest man"[^1]. Higdon died on January 26, 2022, at the age of 81, having never altered his story in the 47 years following the alleged encounter[^1].

The Higdon case has been featured in numerous books, documentaries, and podcasts dedicated to UFO phenomena. In January 2024, the podcast "The Saucer Life" released an episode titled "Carl Higdon, his Wife, his Therapist, and the Tabloids," examining the various dimensions of the case[^3][^5]. More recently, in March 2024, the "Think Anomalous" podcast discussed Higdon's case, positioning it as potentially shedding "light on other unexplained disappearances and deaths around the world"[^6].

## Conclusion

The Carl Higdon case remains an enigmatic chapter in UFO history. While supporters point to Higdon's consistency and apparent sincerity as evidence for the authenticity of his experience, skeptics highlight methodological issues with the investigation, potential literary influences, and the role of suggestibility in hypnosis.

The case exemplifies the challenges in evaluating claims of extraordinary experiences. Medical explanations such as hallucinations, temporal lobe seizures, or exposure to environmental toxins have been proposed by some researchers as alternative explanations for Higdon's experience, though these remain speculative without definitive evidence.

As with many alleged alien abduction cases from the 1970s, the Higdon incident exists in a grey area where conclusive proof remains elusive. What is clear is that the experience had a profound impact on Higdon's life and has secured a place in the broader cultural narrative surrounding unexplained phenomena in the American West.

The 50th anniversary of the McCarty Canyon incident in October 2024 will likely renew interest in this compelling yet controversial case that continues to challenge our understanding of human perception, memory, and the boundaries of known experience.
